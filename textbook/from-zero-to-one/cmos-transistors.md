# CMOS Transistors

_Transistors_ are electrically controlled switches that turn ON or OFF when a voltage or current is applied to a control terminal. The two main types of transistors are

1. bipolar junction transistors (BJT)
2. metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs or MOS transistors, pronounced "moss-fets" or "M-O-S", respectively)

Nowadays, MOSFETs are the building blocks of almost all digital systems.

## Semiconductors

MOSFETs are built from silicon.

## Diodes

The junction between p-type and n-type silicon is called a _diode_. The p-type region is called the _anode_ and the n-type region is called the _cathode_, as illustrated in Figure 1.27.

When the voltage on the anode rises above the voltage on the cathode, the diode is _forward biased_, and current flows through the diode from the anode to the cathode. But when the anode voltage is lower than the voltage on the cathode, the diode is _reverse biased_, and no current flows. The diode symbol intuitively shows that current only flows in **one direction**.

## Capacitors

A _capacitor_ consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. When a voltage V is applied to **one of the conductors**, the conductor accumulates electric charge Q and the other conductor accumulates the opposite charge -Q.

The _capacitance_ C of the capacitor is the ratio of charge to voltage: $$C=Q/V$$. The capacitance is proportional to the size of the conductors and inversely proportional to the distance between them. The symbol of a capacitor is shown in Figure 1.28.

Capacitance is important because charging or discharging a conductor takes time and energy. More capacitance means that a circuit will be slower and require more energy to operate. Speed and energy will be discussed throughout this book.
