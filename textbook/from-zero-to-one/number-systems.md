## Bytes, Nibbles, and All that Jazz

1. A group of 8 bits is called a _byte_.
2. A group of four bits, or half a byte, is called a _nibble_.
3. Microprocessors[^1] handle data in chunks called _words_.

{% hint style="info" %}
The size of a word depends on the architecture of the microprocessor. For example, most computers nowadays had 64-bit processors, indicating that they operate on 64-bit words.

[^1]: In this textbook, "Microprocessor" and "processor" are used interchangeably.
